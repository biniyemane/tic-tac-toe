# React + Vite

This project is a classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game features an interactive user interface where two players can take turns marking the squares on a 3x3 grid. It is designed to dynamically update the board based on user actions, and the game automatically determines the winner or detects a draw. Key features include:

Reusable Components: The game is structured using React components (Board, Square, and Game), promoting modularity and reusability.
State Management: Utilizes Reactâ€™s state and hooks to manage the game state, including keeping track of the current player, moves history, and winner detection.
Responsive Design: The game is styled to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
Winner Calculation: Implements a calculateWinner function to check for winning combinations after each move.
This project demonstrates the power of React in building interactive and responsive web applications and serves as a great foundation for exploring more advanced React concepts.
